# Bimodal Multigraph

Typically when drawing and projecting a bimodal network onto one of its two types, the information about the other type is collapsed into an edge weight, resulting in information loss. This function preserves this information as a multigraph. 

The place is to turn this into a package eventually, as a learning project.
